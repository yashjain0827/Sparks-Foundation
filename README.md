# Donation Web Page with Razorpay Payment Integration

This project was developed as part of my internship at The Sparks Foundation. The goal was to create a fully functional donation web page with Razorpay payment gateway integration.

**Live Demo:** [Donation Web Page](https://yashjain0827.github.io/Sparks-Foundation/)

## Features

- Responsive design using **HTML** and **CSS**
- Interactive elements using **JavaScript**
- Seamless payment integration with **Razorpay**

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage
- **CSS**: For styling and making the page responsive
- **JavaScript**: For form validation and dynamic behavior
- **Razorpay API**: For integrating the payment gateway

## How It Works

1. Users can navigate to the donation page.
2. Users can explore the services and awards sections.
3. Users can fill in their donation details and make secure payments via Razorpay.


## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the donation page.

3. For payment gateway functionality, you will need to integrate your own **Razorpay API keys**. Instructions to do this can be found on the [Razorpay documentation](https://razorpay.com/docs/).
